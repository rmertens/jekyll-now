I really enjoy [Greg Linden](https://glinden.blogspot.com)'s +- bi-monthly quick links.
Here's what caught my attention recently:
- Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, discusses their security.
This includes *"special machines in the office that are in a locked room, that you only use for SSH access"*
and cameras to monitor who accesses these machines.
They also share that *"98% of customer bitcoin private keys are stored entirely offline"* and keys
are split and geographically distributed.

- For someone who stopped following JavaScript when jQuery was all you needed, this
State of the JavaScript Landscape: A Map for Newcomers provides a good overview.
Their starter kit is also my current frontend development setup (React, Babel, Webpack, ES6).

- Interesting profile of Vitalik Buterin, inventor of Ethereum (before he turned 20!) and universally respected.

- If you want to know someone's personality, just ask how they perceive others.
*"The more frequently people rated others as kindhearted, happy, emotionally stable, or courteous,
the more likely they were to rate themselves as having these traits, and the more likely outside evaluators were to agree"*

- Minecraft has captured a generation and taught millions of kids to be creative and
solve difficult problems.
