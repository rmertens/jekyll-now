As of June 2016, I am working primarily a personal finance project
(a blog post with more details will follow). Besides that, I work on
[CrazyGames.com](https://www.crazygames.com). CrazyGames is a casual games
portal with about 3 million monthly visits. There are also
[Dutch](https://www.speelspelletjes.nl),
[Spanish](https://www.1001juegos.com), and
[Italian](https://www.gioca.re) versions.

Previously I worked as a software engineer at
[Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/) from the summer of 2015
until March 2016.

In the 2014-2015 academic year, I did
[Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos)
at Cambridge and studied a variety of **applied mathematics** subjects
with a focus in statistics.

Before that, I studied **Computer Science** and **Electrical Engineering** at
Stanford University, where I won the Terman Award.
I focused on **machine learning** and **convex optimization**. I transferred to Stanford after 1 academic year at KU Leuven.

In my free time, I enjoy long distance running and travelling.

Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to grab a coffee.
